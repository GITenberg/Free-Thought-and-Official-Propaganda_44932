<h1 id='t29'>CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>I have</span> come here to-night, partly because I want
to hear Mr. Russell, and partly because of an old
affection for South Place and its traditions. I
myself have been for more than forty years a
professional teacher; and it is as a teacher—who
thirty-seven years ago was dismissed for refusing
religious conformity—that I most easily approach
the problem of free thought. Though systems of
education professing to teach men and women
how to think have been in use in Europe for,
perhaps, three thousand years, we have not yet
reached that degree of success which would be
shown if most educated people came to much the
same conclusions on the great problems of life
from a study of the same evidence. Everywhere
you have rebels; but ninety per cent. of French
or American students of history come to French
or American conclusions, and eighty-five per cent.
of English students come to English conclusions;
eighty per cent. of Eton boys hold Eton political
opinions all their lives; ninety per cent. of the
Irish Catholic population of the United States
seem to hold generation after generation identical
opinions on religion and politics which are not
held by the vast majority of Americans. It may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
be said that in these cases only one kind of
evidence is allowed to reach the students in each
institution. But everybody reads newspapers,
and talks with his neighbours, and travels, and
visits museums; and most intelligent people read
books and magazines. Sooner or later much of
the same evidence reaches us all. I myself believe
that one of the main reasons why we do not to a
greater degree draw the same conclusions from
that evidence is that we do not really learn the
difficult art of thought. A boy at school is taught
to memorize and to understand mathematical
formulæ or foreign languages or scientific statements.
But in weighing evidence the effort of
memorizing, and even the effort of understanding,
are not of the first importance. The effective
process is a sort of painful and watchful expectancy.
A schoolboy or a college student finds
that he has an uncomfortable sense of unreality
in repeating some accustomed formula, or writing
an essay to enforce some accustomed line of
argument. He shrinks from that feeling, as all
animals shrink from discomfort. If he were
taught what are the conditions of effective thought,
and were encouraged to act on that lesson, he
would know that it is only by resolutely fastening
on such vague and painful premonitions, and
forcing them to come into full consciousness and
disclose their deeper causes and tendencies that
he can arrive at new truth or make some old truth
his own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
But who is going to tell him this secret?
Every day in London thousands of clever and
sympathetic boys and girls begin the day by
sitting through three-quarters of an hour of the
dreary “Cowper-Temple” instruction which consists,
as Bishop Temple once said, of teaching at
everybody’s expense what nobody believes. They
may be conscious or half-conscious of a feeling of
unreality; but, even if they have not been taught
that it is a sacred duty to “struggle against
doubt,” they shrink, as the cleverest of them feel
that the teacher is shrinking, from any further
exploration on that path.</p>

<p>Perhaps some day the teachers and students
of the ordinary school and college subjects may
learn something from those little isolated institutions
where men and women try to prepare themselves
for the creative arts. The young painter
or sculptor or member of a group of young poets
is often queerly ignorant and one-sided. But he
lives in another world from that of the big conventional
sixth-form boy at Harrow or St. Paul’s,
or the hockey-playing athlete of a girls’ High
School, because he has felt the pain and the
exhilaration reached through pain by which
alone new truth and new beauty are born into
the world.</p>

<h1 id='t121'>FREE THOUGHT AND<br /> OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA</h1>

<p><span class='sc'>Moncure Conway</span>, in whose honour we are
assembled to-day, devoted his life to two great
objects: freedom of thought and freedom of
the individual. In regard to both these
objects, something has been gained since his
time, but something also has been lost. New
dangers, somewhat different in form from
those of past ages, threaten both kinds of
freedom, and unless a vigorous and vigilant
public opinion can be aroused in defence of
them, there will be much less of both a
hundred years hence than there is now. My
purpose in this address is to emphasize the
new dangers and to consider how they can
be met.</p>

<p>Let us begin by trying to be clear as to
what we mean by “free thought.” This
expression has two senses. In its narrower
sense it means thought which does not accept
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
the dogmas of traditional religion. In this
sense a man is a “free thinker” if he is not
a Christian or a Mussulman or a Buddhist or
a Shintoist or a member of any of the other
bodies of men who accept some inherited
orthodoxy. In Christian countries a man is
called a “free thinker” if he does not decidedly
believe in God, though this would not suffice
to make a man a “free thinker” in a Buddhist
country.</p>

<p>I do not wish to minimize the importance
of free thought in this sense. I am myself
a dissenter from all known religions, and I
hope that every kind of religious belief will
die out. I do not believe that, on the balance,
religious belief has been a force for good.
Although I am prepared to admit that in
certain times and places it has had some good
effects, I regard it as belonging to the infancy
of human reason, and to a stage of development
which we are now outgrowing.</p>

<p>But there is also a wider sense of “free
thought,” which I regard as of still greater
importance. Indeed, the harm done by traditional
religions seems chiefly traceable to the
fact that they have prevented free thought in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
this wider sense. The wider sense is not so
easy to define as the narrower, and it will be
well to spend some little time in trying to
arrive at its essence.</p>

<p>When we speak of anything as “free,” our
meaning is not definite unless we can say
what it is free <i>from</i>. Whatever or whoever
is “free” is not subject to some external compulsion,
and to be precise we ought to say
what this kind of compulsion is. Thus
thought is “free” when it is free from certain
kinds of outward control which are often
present. Some of these kinds of control which
must be absent if thought is to be “free” are
obvious, but others are more subtle and
elusive.</p>

<p>To begin with the most obvious. Thought
is not “free” when legal penalties are incurred
by the holding or not holding of certain
opinions, or by giving expression to one’s
belief or lack of belief on certain matters.
Very few countries in the world have as yet
even this elementary kind of freedom. In
England, under the Blasphemy Laws, it is
illegal to express disbelief in the Christian
religion, though in practice the law is not set
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
in motion against the well-to-do. It is also
illegal to teach what Christ taught on the
subject of non-resistance. Therefore, whoever
wishes to avoid becoming a criminal
must profess to agree with Christ’s teaching,
but must avoid saying what that teaching
was. In America no one can enter the
country without first solemnly declaring that
he disbelieves in anarchism and polygamy;
and, once inside, he must also disbelieve in
communism. In Japan it is illegal to express
disbelief in the divinity of the Mikado. It
will thus be seen that a voyage round the
world is a perilous adventure. A Mohammedan,
a Tolstoyan, a Bolshevik, or a Christian
cannot undertake it without at some point
becoming a criminal, or holding his tongue
about what he considers important truths.
This, of course, applies only to steerage
passengers; saloon passengers are allowed
to believe whatever they please, provided they
avoid offensive obtrusiveness.</p>

<p>It is clear that the most elementary condition,
if thought is to be free, is the absence
of legal penalties for the expression of
opinions. No great country has yet reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
to this level, although most of them think
they have. The opinions which are still
persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous
and immoral that the general principle of
toleration cannot be held to apply to them.
But this is exactly the same view as that
which made possible the tortures of the
Inquisition. There was a time when Protestantism
seemed as wicked as Bolshevism
seems now. Please do not infer from this
remark that I am either a Protestant or a
Bolshevik.</p>

<p>Legal penalties are, however, in the modern
world, the least of the obstacles to freedom of
thoughts. The two great obstacles are economic
penalties and distortion of evidence. It
is clear that thought is not free if the profession
of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn
a living. It is clear also that thought is not
free if all the arguments on one side of a controversy
are perpetually presented as attractively
as possible, while the arguments on the
other side can only be discovered by diligent
search. Both these obstacles exist in every
large country known to me, except China,
which is the last refuge of freedom. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
these obstacles with which I shall be concerned—their
present magnitude, the likelihood
of their increase, and the possibility of
their diminution.</p>

<p>We may say that thought is free when it is
exposed to free competition among beliefs—i.e.,
when all beliefs are able to state their
case, and no legal or pecuniary advantages or
disadvantages attach to beliefs. This is an
ideal which, for various reasons, can never
be fully attained. But it is possible to
approach very much nearer to it than we do at
present.</p>

<p>Three incidents in my own life will serve
to show how, in modern England, the scales
are weighted in favour of Christianity. My
reason for mentioning them is that many
people do not at all realize the disadvantages
to which avowed Agnosticism still exposes
people.</p>

<p>The first incident belongs to a very early
stage in my life. My father was a Freethinker,
but died when I was only three years old.
Wishing me to be brought up without superstition,
he appointed two Freethinkers as my
guardians. The Courts, however, set aside
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
his will, and had me educated in the Christian
faith. I am afraid the result was disappointing,
but that was not the fault of the law. If he
had directed that I should be educated as
a Christadelphian or a Muggletonian or a
Seventh-Day Adventist, the Courts would not
have dreamed of objecting. A parent has a
right to ordain that any imaginable superstition
shall be instilled into his children after
his death, but has not the right to say that
they shall be kept free from superstition if
possible.</p>

<p>The second incident occurred in the year
1910. I had at that time a desire to stand
for Parliament as a Liberal, and the Whips
recommended me to a certain constituency.
I addressed the Liberal Association, who
expressed themselves favourably, and my
adoption seemed certain. But, on being questioned
by a small inner caucus, I admitted
that I was an Agnostic. They asked whether
the fact would come out, and I said it probably
would. They asked whether I should be
willing to go to church occasionally, and I
replied that I should not. Consequently, they
selected another candidate, who was duly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
elected, has been in Parliament ever since,
and is a member of the present Government.</p>

<p>The third incident occurred immediately
afterwards. I was invited by Trinity College,
Cambridge, to become a lecturer, but not a
Fellow. The difference is not pecuniary; it is
that a Fellow has a voice in the government of
the College, and cannot be dispossessed during
the term of his Fellowship except for grave
immorality. The chief reason for not offering
me a Fellowship was that the clerical party
did not wish to add to the anti-clerical vote.
The result was that they were able to dismiss
me in 1916, when they disliked my views on
the War.<a id='r1' href='#f1' class='fn'><sup>[1]</sup></a> If I had been dependent on my
lectureship, I should have starved.</p>

<p>These three incidents illustrate different
kinds of disadvantages attaching to avowed
freethinking even in modern England. Any
other avowed Freethinker could supply similar
incidents from his personal experience, often
of a far more serious character. The net
result is that people who are not well-to-do
dare not be frank about their religious beliefs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
It is not, of course, only or even chiefly in
regard to religion that there is lack of freedom.
Belief in communism or free love handicaps a
man much more than Agnosticism. Not only
is it a disadvantage to hold those views, but it
is very much more difficult to obtain publicity
for the arguments in their favour. On the
other hand, in Russia the advantages and disadvantages
are exactly reversed: comfort and
power are achieved by professing Atheism,
communism, and free love, and no opportunity
exists for propaganda against these opinions.
The result is that in Russia one set of fanatics
feels absolute certainty about one set of doubtful
propositions, while in the rest of the world
another set of fanatics feels equal certainty
about a diametrically opposite set of equally
doubtful propositions. From such a situation
war, bitterness, and persecution inevitably
result on both sides.</p>

<p>William James used to preach the “will to
believe.” For my part, I should wish to
preach the “will to doubt.” None of our
beliefs are quite true; all have at least a
penumbra of vagueness and error. The
methods of increasing the degree of truth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
in our beliefs are well known; they consist
in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the
relevant facts, controlling our own bias by
discussion with people who have the opposite
bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard
any hypothesis which has proved inadequate.
These methods are practised in science, and
have built up the body of scientific knowledge.
Every man of science whose outlook is truly
scientific is ready to admit that what passes
for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure
to require correction with the progress of discovery;
nevertheless, it is near enough to the
truth to serve for most practical purposes,
though not for all. In science, where alone
something approximating to genuine knowledge
is to be found, men’s attitude is tentative
and full of doubt.</p>

<p>In religion and politics, on the contrary,
though there is as yet nothing approaching
scientific knowledge, everybody considers it
<i>de rigueur</i> to have a dogmatic opinion, to be
backed up by inflicting starvation, prison,
and war, and to be carefully guarded from
argumentative competition with any different
opinion. If only men could be brought into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
a tentatively agnostic frame of mind about
these matters, nine-tenths of the evils of the
modern world would be cured. War would
become impossible, because each side would
realize that both sides must be in the wrong.
Persecution would cease. Education would
aim at expanding the mind, not at narrowing
it. Men would be chosen for jobs on account
of fitness to do the work, not because they
flattered the irrational dogmas of those in
power. Thus rational doubt alone, if it could
be generated, would suffice to introduce the
millennium.</p>

<p>We have had in recent years a brilliant
example of the scientific temper of mind in
the theory of relativity and its reception by
the world. Einstein, a German-Swiss-Jew
pacifist, was appointed to a research professorship
by the German Government in the
early days of the War; his predictions were
verified by an English expedition which
observed the eclipse of 1919, very soon after
the Armistice. His theory upsets the whole
theoretical framework of traditional physics;
it is almost as damaging to orthodox dynamics
as Darwin was to <i>Genesis</i>. Yet physicists
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
everywhere have shown complete readiness
to accept his theory as soon as it appeared
that the evidence was in its favour. But none
of them, least of all Einstein himself, would
claim that he has said the last word. He has
not built a monument of infallible dogma to
stand for all time. There are difficulties he
cannot solve; his doctrines will have to be
modified in their turn as they have modified
Newton’s. This critical undogmatic receptiveness
is the true attitude of science.</p>

<p>What would have happened if Einstein had
advanced something equally new in the sphere
of religion or politics? English people would
have found elements of Prussianism in his
theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it
as a Zionist plot; nationalists in all countries
would have found it tainted with lily-livered
pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for
escaping military service. All the old-fashioned
professors would have approached
Scotland Yard to get the importation of his
writings prohibited. Teachers favourable to
him would have been dismissed. He, meantime,
would have captured the Government of
some backward country, where it would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
become illegal to teach anything except his
doctrine, which would have grown into a
mysterious dogma not understood by anybody.
Ultimately the truth or falsehood of
his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield,
without the collection of any fresh
evidence for or against it. This method is
the logical outcome of William James’s will
to believe.</p>

<p>What is wanted is not the will to believe,
but the wish to find out, which is its exact
opposite.</p>

<p>If it is admitted that a condition of rational
doubt would be desirable, it becomes important
to inquire how it comes about that there is so
much irrational certainty in the world. A
great deal of this is due to the inherent
irrationality and credulity of average human
nature. But this seed of intellectual original
sin is nourished and fostered by other agencies,
among which three play the chief part—namely,
education, propaganda, and economic
pressure. Let us consider these in turn.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Education.</i>—Elementary education, in
all advanced countries, is in the hands of the
State. Some of the things taught are known
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
to be false by the officials who prescribe them,
and many others are known to be false, or at
any rate very doubtful, by every unprejudiced
person. Take, for example, the teaching of
history. Each nation aims only at self-glorification
in the school text-books of history.
When a man writes his autobiography he is
expected to show a certain modesty; but
when a nation writes its autobiography there
is no limit to its boasting and vainglory.
When I was young, school books taught that
the French were wicked and the Germans
virtuous; now they teach the opposite. In
neither case is there the slightest regard for
truth. German school books, dealing with
the battle of Waterloo, represent Wellington
as all but defeated when Blücher saved the
situation; English books represent Blücher
as having made very little difference. The
writers of both the German and the English
books know that they are not telling the
truth. American school books used to be
violently anti-British; since the War they
have become equally pro-British, without
aiming at truth in either case (see <i>The Freeman</i>,
Feb. 15, 1922, p. 532). Both before
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
and since, one of the chief purposes of education
in the United States has been to turn
the motley collection of immigrant children
into “good Americans.” Apparently it has
not occurred to any one that a “good American,”
like a “good German” or a “good
Japanese,” must be, <i>pro tanto</i>, a bad human
being. A “good American” is a man or
woman imbued with the belief that America
is the finest country on earth, and ought
always to be enthusiastically supported in
any quarrel. It is just possible that these
propositions are true; if so, a rational man
will have no quarrel with them. But if they
are true, they ought to be taught everywhere,
not only in America. It is a suspicious
circumstance that such propositions are never
believed outside the particular country which
they glorify. Meanwhile the whole machinery
of the State, in all the different countries, is
turned on to making defenceless children
believe absurd propositions the effect of which
is to make them willing to die in defence of
sinister interests under the impression that
they are fighting for truth and right. This is
only one of countless ways in which education
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
is designed, not to give true knowledge, but
to make the people pliable to the will of their
masters. Without an elaborate system of
deceit in the elementary schools it would be
impossible to preserve the camouflage of
democracy.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of education, I
will take another example from America<a id='r2' href='#f2' class='fn'><sup>[2]</sup></a>—not
because America is any worse than other
countries, but because it is the most modern,
showing the dangers that are growing rather
than those that are diminishing. In the State
of New York a school cannot be established
without a licence from the State, even if it is
to be supported wholly by private funds. A
recent law decrees that a licence shall not be
granted to any school “where it shall appear
that the instruction proposed to be given
includes the teachings of the doctrine that
organized Governments shall be overthrown
by force, violence, or unlawful means.” As
the <i>New Republic</i> points out, there is no
limitation to this or that organized Government.
The law therefore would have made
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
it illegal, during the War, to teach the doctrine
that the Kaiser’s Government should be overthrown
by force; and, since then, the support
of Kolchak or Denikin against the Soviet
Government would have been illegal. Such
consequences, of course, were not intended,
and result only from bad draughtsmanship.
What was intended appears from another
law passed at the same time, applying to
teachers in State schools. This law provides
that certificates permitting persons to teach
in such schools shall be issued only to those
who have “shown satisfactorily” that they
are “loyal and obedient to the Government
of this State and of the United States,” and
shall be refused to those who have advocated,
no matter where or when, “a form of government
other than the Government of this State
or of the United States.” The committee
which framed these laws, as quoted by the
<i>New Republic</i>, laid it down that the teacher
who “does not approve of the present social
system......must surrender his office,” and
that “no person who is not eager to combat
the theories of social change should be
entrusted with the task of fitting the young
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
and old for the responsibilities of citizenship.”
Thus, according to the law of the State of
New York, Christ and George Washington
were too degraded morally to be fit for the
education of the young. If Christ were to
go to New York and say, “Suffer the little
children to come unto me,” the President of
the New York School Board would reply:
“Sir, I see no evidence that you are eager to
combat theories of social change. Indeed,
I have heard it said that you advocate what
you call the <i>kingdom</i> of heaven, whereas this
country, thank God, is a republic. It is clear
that the Government of your kingdom of
heaven would differ materially from that of
New York State, therefore no children will be
allowed access to you.” If he failed to make
this reply, he would not be doing his duty as
a functionary entrusted with the administration
of the law.</p>

<p>The effect of such laws is very serious.
Let it be granted, for the sake of argument,
that the government and the social system in
the State of New York are the best that have
ever existed on this planet; yet even then
both would presumably be capable of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
improvement. Any person who admits this obvious
proposition is by law incapable of teaching in
a State school. Thus the law decrees that the
teachers shall all be either hypocrites or fools.</p>

<p>The growing danger exemplified by the
New York law is that resulting from the
monopoly of power in the hands of a single
organization, whether the State or a Trust or
federation of Trusts. In the case of education,
the power is in the hands of the State,
which can prevent the young from hearing of
any doctrine which it dislikes. I believe there
are still some people who think that a democratic
State is scarcely distinguishable from
the people. This, however, is a delusion.
The State is a collection of officials, different
for different purposes, drawing comfortable
incomes so long as the <i>status quo</i> is preserved.
The only alteration they are likely to desire in
the <i>status quo</i> is an increase of bureaucracy
and of the power of bureaucrats. It is, therefore,
natural that they should take advantage
of such opportunities as war excitement to
acquire inquisitorial powers over their employees,
involving the right to inflict starvation
upon any subordinate who opposes them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
In matters of the mind, such as education,
this state of affairs is fatal. It puts an end to
all possibility of progress or freedom or intellectual
initiative. Yet it is the natural result of
allowing the whole of elementary education to
fall under the sway of a single organization.</p>

<p>Religious toleration, to a certain extent, has
been won because people have ceased to consider
religion so important as it was once
thought to be. But in politics and economics,
which have taken the place formerly occupied
by religion, there is a growing tendency to
persecution, which is not by any means confined
to one party. The persecution of opinion
in Russia is more severe than in any capitalist
country. I met in Petrograd an eminent
Russian poet, Alexander Block, who has since
died as the result of privations. The Bolsheviks
allowed him to teach æsthetics, but
he complained that they insisted on his teaching
the subject “from a Marxian point of
view.” He had been at a loss to discover
how the theory of rhythmics was connected
with Marxism, although, to avoid starvation,
he had done his best to find out. Of course,
it has been impossible in Russia ever since
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
the Bolsheviks came into power to print anything
critical of the dogmas upon which their
regime is founded.</p>

<p>The examples of America and Russia illustrate
the conclusion to which we seem to be
driven—namely, that so long as men continue
to have the present fanatical belief in the
importance of politics free thought on political
matters will be impossible, and there is
only too much danger that the lack of freedom
will spread to all other matters, as it has done
in Russia. Only some degree of political
scepticism can save us from this misfortune.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the officials in
charge of education desire the young to become
educated. On the contrary, their problem is
to impart information without imparting intelligence.
Education should have two objects:
first, to give definite knowledge—reading and
writing, languages and mathematics, and so
on; secondly, to create those mental habits
which will enable people to acquire knowledge
and form sound judgments for themselves.
The first of these we may call information,
the second intelligence. The utility of information
is admitted practically as well as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
theoretically; without a literate population a
modern State is impossible. But the utility
of intelligence is admitted only theoretically,
not practically; it is not desired that ordinary
people should think for themselves, because it
is felt that people who think for themselves
are awkward to manage and cause administrative
difficulties. Only the guardians, in
Plato’s language, are to think; the rest are
to obey, or to follow leaders like a herd of
sheep. This doctrine, often unconsciously,
has survived the introduction of political
democracy, and has radically vitiated all
national systems of education.</p>

<p>The country which has succeeded best in
giving information without intelligence is the
latest addition to modern civilization, Japan.
Elementary education in Japan is said to be
admirable from the point of view of instruction.
But, in addition to instruction, it has another
purpose, which is to teach worship of the
Mikado—a far stronger creed now than before
Japan became modernized.<a id='r3' href='#f3' class='fn'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Thus the schools
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
have been used simultaneously to confer knowledge
and to promote superstition. Since we
are not tempted to Mikado-worship, we see
clearly what is absurd in Japanese teaching.
Our own national superstitions strike us as
natural and sensible, so that we do not take
such a true view of them as we do of the
superstitions of Nippon. But if a travelled
Japanese were to maintain the thesis that our
schools teach superstitions just as inimical to
intelligence as belief in the divinity of the
Mikado, I suspect that he would be able to
make out a very good case.</p>

<p>For the present I am not in search of
remedies, but am only concerned with diagnosis.
We are faced with the paradoxical
fact that education has become one of the
chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of
thought. This is due primarily to the fact
that the State claims a monopoly; but that is
by no means the sole cause.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Propaganda.</i>—Our system of education
turns young people out of the schools able to
read, but for the most part unable to weigh
evidence or to form an independent opinion.
They are then assailed, throughout the rest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
of their lives, by statements designed to make
them believe all sorts of absurd propositions,
such as that Blank’s pills cure all ills, that
Spitzbergen is warm and fertile, and that
Germans eat corpses. The art of propaganda,
as practised by modern politicians and governments,
is derived from the art of advertisement.
The science of psychology owes a great deal
to advertisers. In former days most psychologists
would probably have thought that a
man could not convince many people of the
excellence of his own wares by merely stating
emphatically that they were excellent. Experience
shows, however, that they were mistaken
in this. If I were to stand up once in a public
place and state that I am the most modest
man alive, I should be laughed at; but if I
could raise enough money to make the same
statement on all the busses and on hoardings
along all the principal railway lines, people
would presently become convinced that I had
an abnormal shrinking from publicity. If I
were to go to a small shopkeeper and say:
“Look at your competitor over the way, he
is getting your business; don’t you think it
would be a good plan to leave your business
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
and stand up in the middle of the road and
try to shoot him before he shoots you?”—if
I were to say this, any small shopkeeper
would think me mad. But when the Government
says it with emphasis and a brass band,
the small shopkeepers become enthusiastic,
and are quite surprised when they find afterwards
that business has suffered. Propaganda,
conducted by the means which advertisers
have found successful, is now one of
the recognized methods of government in all
advanced countries, and is especially the
method by which democratic opinion is
created.</p>

<p>There are two quite different evils about
propaganda as now practised. On the one
hand, its appeal is generally to irrational
causes of belief rather than to serious argument;
on the other hand, it gives an unfair
advantage to those who can obtain most
publicity, whether through wealth or through
power. For my part, I am inclined to think
that too much fuss is sometimes made about
the fact that propaganda appeals to emotion
rather than reason. The line between emotion
and reason is not so sharp as some people
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
think. Moreover, a clever man could frame
a sufficiently rational argument in favour of
any position which has any chance of being
adopted. There are always good arguments
on both sides of any real issue. Definite
mis-statements of fact can be legitimately
objected to, but they are by no means necessary.
The mere words “Pear’s Soap,” which
affirm nothing, cause people to buy that
article. If, wherever these words appear,
they were replaced by the words “The Labour
Party,” millions of people would be led to
vote for the Labour Party, although the advertisements
had claimed no merit for it whatever.
But if both sides in a controversy were
confined by law to statements which a committee
of eminent logicians considered relevant
and valid, the main evil of propaganda, as at
present conducted, would remain. Suppose,
under such a law, two parties with an equally
good case, one of whom had a million pounds
to spend on propaganda, while the other had
only a hundred thousand. It is obvious that
the arguments in favour of the richer party
would become more widely known than those
in favour of the poorer party, and therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
the richer party would win. This situation is,
of course, intensified when one party is the
Government. In Russia the Government has
an almost complete monopoly of propaganda,
but that is not necessary. The advantages
which it possesses over its opponents will
generally be sufficient to give it the victory,
unless it has an exceptionally bad case.</p>

<p>The objection to propaganda is not only its
appeal to unreason, but still more the unfair
advantage which it gives to the rich and
powerful. Equality of opportunity among
opinions is essential if there is to be real
freedom of thought; and equality of opportunity
among opinions can only be secured
by elaborate laws directed to that end, which
there is no reason to expect to see enacted. The
cure is not to be sought primarily in such
laws, but in better education and a more
sceptical public opinion. For the moment,
however, I am not concerned to discuss cures.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Economic pressure.</i>—I have already
dealt with some aspects of this obstacle to
freedom of thought, but I wish now to deal
with it on more general lines, as a danger
which is bound to increase unless very definite
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
steps are taken to counteract it. The supreme
example of economic pressure applied against
freedom of thought is Soviet Russia, where,
until the trade agreement, the Government
could and did inflict starvation upon people
whose opinions it disliked—for example,
Kropotkin. But in this respect Russia is
only somewhat ahead of other countries. In
France, during the Dreyfus affair, any teacher
would have lost his position if he had been in
favour of Dreyfus at the start or against him
at the end. In America at the present day
I doubt if a university professor, however
eminent, could get employment if he were to
criticize the Standard Oil Company, because
all college presidents have received or hope to
receive benefactions from Mr. Rockefeller.
Throughout America Socialists are marked
men, and find it extremely difficult to obtain
work unless they have great gifts. The tendency,
which exists wherever industrialism is
well developed, for trusts and monopolies to
control all industry, leads to a diminution of
the number of possible employers, so that it
becomes easier and easier to keep secret black
books by means of which any one not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
subservient to the great corporations can be
starved. The growth of monopolies is introducing
in America many of the evils associated
with State Socialism as it has existed in
Russia. From the standpoint of liberty, it
makes no difference to a man whether his
only possible employer is the State or a
Trust.</p>

<p>In America, which is the most advanced
country industrially, and to a lesser extent in
other countries which are approximating to
the American condition, it is necessary for the
average citizen, if he wishes to make a living,
to avoid incurring the hostility of certain big
men. And these big men have an outlook—religious,
moral, and political—with which
they expect their employees to agree, at least
outwardly. A man who openly dissents from
Christianity, or believes in a relaxation of the
marriage laws, or objects to the power of the
great corporations, finds America a very
uncomfortable country, unless he happens to
be an eminent writer. Exactly the same kind
of restraints upon freedom of thought are
bound to occur in every country where
economic organization has been carried to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
point of practical monopoly. Therefore the
safeguarding of liberty in the world which is
growing up is far more difficult than it was in
the nineteenth century, when free competition
was still a reality. Whoever cares about the
freedom of the mind must face this situation
fully and frankly, realizing the inapplicability
of methods which answered well enough while
industrialism was in its infancy.</p>

<p>There are two simple principles which, if
they were adopted, would solve almost all
social problems. The first is that education
should have for one of its aims to teach people
only to believe propositions when there is some
reason to think that they are true. The second
is that jobs should be given solely for fitness
to do the work.</p>

<p>To take the second point first. The habit
of considering a man’s religious, moral, and
political opinions before appointing him to a
post or giving him a job is the modern form
of persecution, and it is likely to become quite
as efficient as the Inquisition ever was. The
old liberties can be legally retained without
being of the slightest use. If, in practice,
certain opinions lead a man to starve, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
poor comfort to him to know that his opinions
are not punishable by law. There is a certain
public feeling against starving men for not
belonging to the Church of England, or for
holding slightly unorthodox opinions in politics.
But there is hardly any feeling against
the rejection of Atheists or Mormons, extreme
communists, or men who advocate free love.
Such men are thought to be wicked, and it is
considered only natural to refuse to employ
them. People have hardly yet waked up to
the fact that this refusal, in a highly industrial
State, amounts to a very rigorous form of
persecution.</p>

<p>If this danger were adequately realized, it
would be possible to rouse public opinion,
and to secure that a man’s beliefs should not
be considered in appointing him to a post.
The protection of minorities is vitally important;
and even the most orthodox of us may
find himself in a minority some day, so that
we all have an interest in restraining the
tyranny of majorities. Nothing except public
opinion can solve this problem. Socialism
would make it somewhat more acute, since it
would eliminate the opportunities that now
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
arise through exceptional employers. Every
increase in the size of industrial undertakings
makes it worse, since it diminishes the number
of independent employers. The battle must
be fought exactly as the battle of religious
toleration was fought. And as in that case,
so in this, a decay in the intensity of belief is
likely to prove the decisive factor. While
men were convinced of the absolute truth of
Catholicism or Protestantism, as the case
might be, they were willing to persecute on
account of them. While men are quite certain
of their modern creeds, they will persecute on
their behalf. Some element of doubt is essential
to the practice, though not to the theory,
of toleration. And this brings me to my other
point, which concerns the aims of education.</p>

<p>If there is to be toleration in the world, one
of the things taught in schools must be the
habit of weighing evidence, and the practice
of not giving full assent to propositions which
there is no reason to believe true. For example,
the art of reading the newspapers should be
taught. The schoolmaster should select some
incident which happened a good many years
ago, and roused political passions in its day.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
He should then read to the school children
what was said by the newspapers on one side,
what was said by those on the other, and some
impartial account of what really happened.
He should show how, from the biased account
of either side, a practised reader could infer
what really happened, and he should make
them understand that everything in newspapers
is more or less untrue. The cynical
scepticism which would result from this teaching
would make the children in later life
immune from those appeals to idealism by
which decent people are induced to further
the schemes of scoundrels.</p>

<p>History should be taught in the same way.
Napoleon’s campaigns of 1813 and 1814, for
instance, might be studied in the <i>Moniteur</i>,
leading up to the surprise which Parisians
felt when they saw the Allies arriving under
the walls of Paris after they had (according to
the official bulletins) been beaten by Napoleon
in every battle. In the more advanced classes,
students should be encouraged to count the
number of times that Lenin has been assassinated
by Trotsky, in order to learn contempt
for death. Finally, they should be given a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
school history approved by the Government,
and asked to infer what a French school
history would say about our wars with France.
All this would be a far better training in
citizenship than the trite moral maxims by
which some people believe that civic duty can
be inculcated.</p>

<p>It must, I think, be admitted that the evils
of the world are due to moral defects quite as
much as to lack of intelligence. But the
human race has not hitherto discovered any
method of eradicating moral defects; preaching
and exhortation only add hypocrisy to
the previous list of vices. Intelligence, on
the contrary, is easily improved by methods
known to every competent educator. Therefore,
until some method of teaching virtue has
been discovered, progress will have to be
sought by improvement of intelligence rather
than of morals. One of the chief obstacles to
intelligence is credulity, and credulity could
be enormously diminished by instruction as to
the prevalent forms of mendacity. Credulity
is a greater evil in the present day than it
ever was before, because, owing to the growth
of education, it is much easier than it used to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
be to spread misinformation, and, owing to
democracy, the spread of misinformation is
more important than in former times to the
holders of power. Hence the increase in the
circulation of newspapers.</p>

<p>If I am asked how the world is to be induced
to adopt these two maxims—namely (1) that
jobs should be given to people on account of
their fitness to perform them; (2) that one
aim of education should be to cure people of
the habit of believing propositions for which
there is no evidence—I can only say that it
must be done by generating an enlightened
public opinion. And an enlightened public
opinion can only be generated by the efforts
of those who desire that it should exist. I do
not believe that the economic changes advocated
by Socialists will, of themselves, do
anything towards curing the evils we have
been considering. I think that, whatever
happens in politics, the trend of economic
development will make the preservation of
mental freedom increasingly difficult, unless
public opinion insists that the employer shall
control nothing in the life of the employee
except his work. Freedom in education could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
easily be secured, if it were desired, by limiting
the function of the State to inspection and
payment, and confining inspection rigidly to
the definite instruction. But that, as things
stand, would leave education in the hands of
the Churches, because, unfortunately, they
are more anxious to teach their beliefs than
Freethinkers are to teach their doubts. It
would, however, give a free field, and would
make it possible for a liberal education to be
given if it were really desired. More than
that ought not to be asked of the law.</p>

<p>My plea throughout this address has been
for the spread of the scientific temper, which
is an altogether different thing from the knowledge
of scientific results. The scientific
temper is capable of regenerating mankind
and providing an issue for all our troubles.
The results of science, in the form of
mechanism, poison gas, and the yellow press,
bid fair to lead to the total downfall of our
civilization. It is a curious antithesis, which
a Martian might contemplate with amused
detachment. But for us it is a matter of life
and death. Upon its issue depends the
question whether our grandchildren are to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
live in a happier world, or are to exterminate
each other by scientific methods, leaving
perhaps to negroes and Papuans the future
destinies of mankind.</p>

<h1 id='t1129'>APPENDIX<br />&ensp;<br />THE CONWAY MEMORIAL LECTURESHIP</h1>

<p>At a general meeting of the South Place Ethical
Society, held on October 22, 1908, it was resolved,
after full discussion, that an effort should be made
to establish a series of lectures, to be printed and
widely circulated, as a permanent Memorial to
Dr. Conway.</p>

<p>Moncure Conway’s untiring zeal for the emancipation
of the human mind from the thraldom of
obsolete or waning beliefs, his pleadings for
sympathy with the oppressed and for a wider and
profounder conception of human fraternity than
the world has yet reached, claim, it is urged, an
offering of gratitude more permanent than the
eloquent obituary or reverential service of
mourning.</p>

<p>The range of the lectures (of which the thirteenth
is published herewith) must be regulated by the
financial support accorded to the scheme; but it
is hoped that sufficient funds will be eventually
forthcoming for the endowment of periodical
lectures by distinguished public men, to further
the cause of social, political, and religious freedom,
with which Dr. Conway’s name must ever be
associated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
The Conway Memorial Lecture Committee,
although not yet in possession of the necessary
capital for the permanent endowment of the
Lectureship, have inaugurated and maintained
the work while inviting further contributions.
The funds in hand, together with those which
may reasonably be expected from supporters of
the Movement, will ensure the delivery of an
annual lecture for some years at least.</p>

<p>The Committee earnestly appeal for either
donations or subscriptions from year to year
until the Memorial is permanently established.
Contributions may be forwarded to the Hon.
Treasurer.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
